    <p><b>Why use a custom Mouth Guard?</b></p>
		  
		  The purpose of the sports mouth guard is to act as a shock absorber in the mouth to protect the teeth
		  from excessive forces.  The mouth guard also protects your head and brain from concussion if the blow is onto
		  the lower jaw.<br>
		  <br>
		  
		  Well made mouth guards adapt smoothly to the upper teeth and gums, staying firmly in place, even when speaking,
		  breathing heavily or playing sports very actively.<br>
		  <br>
		  <p><b>The Procedure</b></p>
		  
		  A custom mouth guard procedure is very quick and lasts approximately 10 minutes. The dental Hygienist will take 
		  an upper impression, you will choose the color of your mouth guard and it will be ready in approximately one week.
		  Dental Hygiene on the move offers a variety of colors for all ages.<br>
		  <br>
		  <p><b>Cost</b></p>
		  
		   $40.00 - Per Mouth Guard<br>
