		    <h2>Kari Flaxey</h2>
			Registered Dental Hygienist<br>
			<br>
			Kari graduated with honours from Canadore College in North Bay in 2007.  She began practicing in her home town of 
			New Liskeard at a local Dentist office for 5 years which included orthodontics before moving to the local health unit 
			where she is currently employed.<br>
			<br>
			Dental Hygiene on the Move originated by Kari's motivation to do something different.  With limited public
			transportation and several rural areas surrounding New Liskeard, it was difficult for some families to get 
			to the local dentist offices.  Kari wanted to give everyone in the area an opportunity to receive proper 
			dental hygiene regardless of their location.  With the support of the community and her current employer at 
			the same, Kari launched Dental Hygiene on the Move.   Although it was something new to the area, Kari thought 
			it would benefit alot of people and she was determined to make it a success.
